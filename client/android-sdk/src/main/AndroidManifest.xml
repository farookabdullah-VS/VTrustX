  Minimal manifest for the VTrustX Android SDK library.
  Library manifests are merged into the host app's manifest at build time;
  no activities, services, or permissions are declared here because the SDK
  does not require them — all runtime permissions (INTERNET, etc.) must be
  declared by the consuming application.
